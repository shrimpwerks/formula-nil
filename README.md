## Lore

1. Scuderia Spaghetti

    Tagline: “Fast, but only in the straights between espresso stops.”
    - Lance Concolini – forever blaming “the pasta setup” for bad laps
    - Nick Barrantesi – serious, disciplined older brother; hates Shane’s flair

2. Red Bison Racing

    Tagline: “Like Red Bull, but the wings are duct-taped on.”
    - Trung Fanelli – aggressive overtaker, always in trouble with stewards
    - Trevor Ferretti – media darling, more influencer than driver

3. McFlaren International

    Tagline: “Innovating excuses faster than cars.”
    - Alea McCauletti – calculating strategist, saves fuel but never overtakes
    - Shane Barrantesi – fiery ex-jockey, team’s wildcard


4. Mercedes-Bends GP

    Tagline: “Bending rules and budget caps since day one.”
    - Brett Breckenridgi – confident but always “out-qualified by a tenth”
    - Grace Giacchetti – team’s PR face, secretly faster than Brett

5. Ferraro Rosso Corse

    Tagline: “Glorious heritage of crashing in style.”
    - John Molinari – hometown hero, cries on the podium… even for P8
    - Cooper Giacchetti – sibling rivalry fuel, insists he’s faster than Grace

6. Alphonso Romeo Pizza

    Tagline: “The sausage sponsor makes more horsepower than our car.”
    - Ty Scheletoni – lanky, terrible at weight distribution
    - Heather Daliberti – analytical driver, tries to fix the car mid-race

7. Haas-Beens F1 Team

    Tagline: “Still searching for a points finish.”
    - Tristan Harelli – always on the radio complaining
    - Rhett Diemotti – crashes spectacularly, blames tire temps
    - Griffo Haas

8. Williams-Sonoma Racing

    Tagline: “The slowest car, but at least the catering is exquisite.”
    - Jonah Giorgetti – smooth operator, but never leaves last place
    - Test Driver: Shane Barrantesi’s cousin? No—better: rotating junior role. For now: Grace & Cooper’s cousin ‘Mario Giacchetti’ (fictional filler to balance).
