Generate a semi-realistic vintage portrait in the style of mid-20th century oil paintings, inspired by Warthunder player pictures. The subject is depicted as a race car driver with recognizable facial features preserved from the input photos. They wear a vintage racing suit and helmet with goggles (color of suit and helmet can be specified). The painting is gritty and textured, with muted earthy backgrounds, soft directional lighting, and visible brushstrokes. Expression is serious, stoic, or calm, evoking the atmosphere of old racing posters. No modern elements.
