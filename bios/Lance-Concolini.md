Lance Concolini – The Maestro of the Pasta Setup

Early Life in Emilia-Romagna
Lance Concolini was born in Modena, Italy — the beating heart of motorsport and pasta. His father owned a small trattoria near the Ferrari factory, and his mother ran a go-kart track behind the restaurant, where local kids could pay €5 to “race” while their parents ordered carbonara. Lance grew up splitting time between the two: learning how to throw a kart into a hairpin while also mastering the art of stirring Bolognese.

By the time he was 10, he was known as “Il Piccolo Schumacher di Modena” (the Little Schumacher of Modena)… though locals admit the nickname came less from his racing talent and more because his kart smelled faintly of garlic.

Rise Through Junior Categories
Concolini rose through Italian Formula 4 and Formula 3, notorious not for dominance but for his colorful excuses. Mechanics say he had an uncanny ability to invent culinary metaphors for every technical issue: if the car understeered, it was “too much gnocchi on the front axle.” If the brakes faded, it was “spaghetti overcooked.”

Despite middling results, Lance developed a loyal following in Italy. His fans, the Tifosi della Pasta, waved penne-shaped flags at circuits and chanted “Al Dente! Al Dente!” whenever he overtook someone.

Formula 2: The Spaghetti Years
In Formula 2, Lance’s raw speed occasionally shone through — especially on street circuits where chaos rewarded his opportunistic style. But he also earned a reputation for radio rants that bordered on performance art:
	•	“The car, she feels like lasagna with no cheese!”
	•	“Mama mia, why you give me tortellini tires in the rain?!”

Sponsors loved him because he was quotable. Engineers despised him because his feedback made zero sense.

Formula 1 Career
Eventually, Lance Concolini secured a seat at Scuderia Spaghetti, an underfunded but passionately Italian team that cared more about espresso breaks than wind tunnel hours. Though rarely a contender for points, Lance became a cult hero of the grid. He’s often at the center of mid-pack melees, his car plastered with obscure pasta brand sponsors.

When interviewed, Lance insists he’s only one proper setup away from greatness. Unfortunately, that setup never seems to exist outside of his imagination: the legendary “pasta setup.”
